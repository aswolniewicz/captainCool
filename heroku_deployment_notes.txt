Hi Friends! We are online... but in order to do so the file system has changed and how you render the index has changed
1. Make sure python and pip are installed on your machine
2. Now, pip install -r requirements.txt when you are in the captainCool directory 
3. OK, so to run on your local machine, go to terminal and within the directory type python app.py
4. It will show you the port it is serving to, go to the port

Notes:
1. We are using my Heroku account so I can push the final project up to our website hosted by Heroky
2. In order to use Heroku the js files and img files have to be in a folder called static. So if you add a key and 
need to add an image path, make sure it matches the other paths... something like ../static/img/thenameoftheimage
3. In the same vein, the index file is now in a folder called templates.
4. you can find our app at https://captaincool.herokuapp.com/
