What are the folders for?
	css = will hold all the .css files
	font = will hold all the font files (fonts = buttload of confusing files)
	img = will hold all the images
	js = will hold all the .js files
	media = will hold the sounds

Why is there index.html?
	When a file run, and it is meant to run an .html file, it defaults to
	index.html. This will make our search bar look SO much nicer.

Why so many folders?
	For our sanity as this project grows!! Folders are neat and clean. 
	Coding can be hectic. Feel free to add more!

Why is there a game.js?
	I'm used to seperating my code into different files,
	I just used game.js to test if the same can apply to javascript,
	It totally can
