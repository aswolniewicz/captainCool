## Project Title  
Captan Cool  

## Vision  
We want to introduce people to coding in a less intimidating way.  

## Game Testing  
For this project, we're using Jasmine to test our javascript. Because we are making a game, Jasmine is only testing invisible functions, and arrays that are not displayed. The rest is implimented in the game itself, such as having the character react as they encounter a wall, or having collisions displayed in the feed below the canvas. As it is a game, most actions are tested in the game itself.  
To run the automated testing, just open SpecRunner.html.
