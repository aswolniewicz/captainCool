## Project Title:  
Captain Cool  

## Description:  
We're creating an educational 2d browser game centered around programming and computer science. The game will consist of simple puzzles that the user will have to solve using common computer science tools and concepts.

## Vision statement:  
We want to introduce people to coding in a less intimidating way.  

## Movitation:  
Thereâ€™s a stigma around programming, which prevents many from studying it. We hope to help people learn in a stress-free environment.  

## Risks:  
* We haven't worked together before.  
* We haven't created games before.  
* 3/4 of us aren't familiar with javascript.  
* We have no domain.  
* We haven't created/maintained a website before.  

## Risk Mitigation:  
We need to learn javascript.  
We need to communicate.  

## Requirements:

1. User  
2. Functional  
  * Pause menu and main menu   
  * Tips and hints    
  * Specifc and helpful error messages with failed solutions  
  * Progress must be trackable   
  * Backtracking and replayability  
  * Solutions are explained  
  * Character customization  
  * Music and sound effects  
  * Tutorial  
  * Settings  
3. Non-functional  
  * Page must load quickly (idk how fast)  
  * Game must run quickly (idk how fast)

  * Playable offline  
  * Local and online saves?
