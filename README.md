## Project Title:  
Captain Cool  

## Description:  
We're creating an educational 2d browser game centered around programming and computer science. The game will consist of simple puzzles that the user will have to solve using common computer science tools and concepts.

## Vision statement:  
We want to introduce people to coding in a less intimidating way.  

## Movitation:  
Thereâ€™s a stigma around programming, which prevents many from studying it. We hope to help people learn in a stress-free environment.  

## Risks:  
* We haven't worked together before.  
* We haven't created games before.  
* 3/4 of us aren't familiar with javascript.  
* We have no domain.  
* We haven't created/maintained a website before.  

## Risk Mitigation:  
We need to learn javascript.  
We need to communicate.  

## Requirements:   
1. User Stories
  * 001: As a developer, I want to create the HTML canvas using JavaScript so that the team can start working on the game. (3 hours)
  * 002: As a developer, I want to create a moving block that users can control via the keyboard, so the team can build the functionality behind the game. (4 hours)
  * 003: As a developer, I want to create an artistic background and begin development of the sprites and characters. By doing this, the team can start putting the game together. (7 hours)
  * 004: As a developer, I want to design puzzles that the user will have to solve, to drive the user forward through the plot. By doing this we will give our game a purpose. (5 hours)
  * 005: As a developer, I want to implement the puzzles in order for the user to be able to interact with them via the keyboard. (7 hours)
  * 006: As a team, we want a working version of our game so that we can demo it for our peers. (8 hours) 
2. Functional  
  * Pause menu and main menu   
  * Tips and hints    
  * Specifc and helpful error messages with failed solutions  
  * Progress must be trackable   
  * Backtracking and replayability  
  * Solutions are explained  
  * Character customization  
  * Music and sound effects  
  * Tutorial  
  * Settings  
3. Non-functional  
  * Page must load quickly (idk how fast)  
  * Game must run quickly (idk how fast)  
  * Controls must be responsive (idk how fast)  
  * Playable offline  
  * Local and online saves?  
  * Supports multiple browsers?
